# DEVELOPER DEVICE WHITELIST
# ============================================================================
# To allow Developer Options on your physical device (even in release builds):
# 1. Run the app in debug mode on your device
# 2. Open Developer Options from Settings
# 3. Check logcat for the "DEV_ACCESS" tag - it will show your device hash
# 4. Paste that hash below (it looks like a long hex string)
#
# Example: DEVELOPER_DEVICE_HASH=a1b2c3d4e5f6...
#
# IMPORTANT: This file may be checked into version control.
# For security, set the real value in local.properties (which is gitignored).
